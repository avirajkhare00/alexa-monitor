# alexa-monitor

Simple web crawler to collect [alexa](alexa.com) rank of a website and store in database.


## Installation

Install dependencies:
```
lein deps
```


## Usage

Run:
```
lein run
```

```
lein uberjar
```

And run the Jar file:
```
java -jar target/uberjar/alexa-monitor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

Create GraalVM native-image:
```
lein native-image
```

Generate docs (follow instructions from [Marginalia](https://github.com/gdeer81/lein-marginalia)):
```
lein marg -f index.html
```


### Local Sample data
There's a sample html file in `resources` directory, all links are changed to point at `localhost` so it's basically an ugly copy of Alexa`s Mini Siteinfo. You can run a simple webserver on port 8080 to serve this file, and use that for test (instead of submitting actual requests to alexa.com)
```
cd resources
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
